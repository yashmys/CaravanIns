1) How do you frame your main question as a machine learning problem? Is it a supervised or unsupervised problem? If it is supervised, is it a regression or a classification?
   Its a supervised  classification problem. 
   
2) What are the main features (also called independent variables or predictors) that you'll use?
   Its a high dimension set with 86 variables. I  intend to use all of them.

3) Which machine learning technique will you use?
    Random forest

4) How will you evaluate the success of your machine learning technique? What metric will you use
   I will use OBB error to check the accuracy
